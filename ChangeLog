	* Version 0.4: Source-level backward compatibility is OK! 
	but you need to install cvs/kcompat headers.
	* should.h/should.c: Change function names from VERB_should_OBJ, 
	to should_VERB_OBJ and add #defines for old names.
	* should.h/should.c: Include <kcompat/kcompat.h> and add
	#define SHOULD_DECLARE_UNIT/SHOULD_RETURN_SUITE
	they help you to use should in kernel space.
	* should.h/should.c: Change types of should_add_xxx functions from
	void to int for more careful use in kernel space.
	* should.c: Check if setup returns null for more careful use.
	both of user and kernel space.
